Our project analyzes trends, posts, hashtags and comments on social media about 
fashion.
Analysis of these trends will allow us to provide meaningful insights to brands and designers 
to help them understand their customers better and 
be more conscious about their production.
The goal of our analysis was to draw out any notable 
relationships between istagram, fashion consumers 
and a trend toward sustainable production practices 
and/or diversity.

We use topic modeling and NER for our analysis.
